>>>>>>>Reflections and Comments: Hard coding time was less then i thought but I did spend approx 4-6 Hours doing product research and CSS layout and development,  
I would bill this out as time required to complete the job,  
Total Hours i would charge for my work so far is: 8 Hours,   
This would take me less time in the future.  
I'd currently charge $35 an hour if this was a payed job.
